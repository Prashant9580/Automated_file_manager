Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it here.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Run the Python script: Run the code from your local environment (e.g., VS Code or command line) to see the automated file organization in action.

How to Use
Set up the base directory:

Ensure that your target files are in the combine folder within the specified base directory (e.g., D:\SHUTIL\combine).
Run the script:

Execute the Python script, and it will create folders (documents, image, txt) in the base directory and organize files by type.
Output:

After running, the combine folder's contents will be moved to the appropriate folders based on file extension.
Example Code Snippet
Here‚Äôs a sample of how the project code works:

python Copy code
import shutil
import os

# Define the base folder and file categories
folders = ["documents", "image", "txt", "combine"]
base_dir = "D:\\SHUTIL\\"

# Code to create folders and organize files by type
...
Project Structure
sql
Copy code
|-- D:\SHUTIL\
|   |-- combine\             # Folder with mixed file types to be organized
|   |-- documents\           # Folder for PDF files
|   |-- image\               # Folder for JPG files
|   |-- txt\                 # Folder for TXT files
Future Enhancements
